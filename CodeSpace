Research Design: Mixed-methods sequential explanatory design

Phase 1 - Quantitative (Months 1-3):
• Cross-sectional survey research with stratified random sampling
• Self-administered questionnaires (online: 70%, offline: 30%)
• Target response rate: 65% (industry standard for automotive surveys)

Phase 2 - Qualitative (Months 4-5):
• 6 focus group discussions (8-10 participants per group)
• 10-15 in-depth interviews with industry experts
• Thematic analysis of qualitative data using NVivo software

Data Integration:
• Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings
• Joint displays for data comparison and interpretation
• Mixed-methods inference quality assessment
