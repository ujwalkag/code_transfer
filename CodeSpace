Sample Size: 385 respondents (calculated using 95% confidence level, ±5% margin of error)

Distribution Strategy:
• Tier-1 cities: 200 respondents (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai)
• Tier-2 cities: 135 respondents (Indore, Pune, Lucknow, Coimbatore) 
• Tier-3 cities: 50 respondents (Ujjain, Dewas, Ratlam, Mandsaur)

Justification: This sample size aligns with industry standards for automotive consumer behavior research. Recent studies by automotive researchers in India have used similar sample sizes - Kumar et al. (2024) used 400 respondents, while a comprehensive EV adoption study in Lucknow collected 1,123 responses across multiple showrooms.
