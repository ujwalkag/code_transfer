Statistical Testing Framework:

H1 Testing: Multiple regression analysis will examine the relationship between environmental consciousness, cost perception, and EV preference. Standardized coefficients (β) will indicate the strength of relationships.

H2 Testing: Chi-square test of independence will analyze the association between infrastructure confidence and petrol vehicle preference across different city tiers.

H3 Testing: ANOVA will compare the effectiveness of different marketing messages (green vs. performance-focused) across age groups and education levels.

Expected Statistical Outcomes:
• R² values > 0.30 indicating meaningful explanatory power
• Significance levels at p < 0.05 for primary hypotheses
• Effect sizes (Cohen's d) > 0.30 for practical significance
• Confidence intervals (95%) for all parameter estimates
