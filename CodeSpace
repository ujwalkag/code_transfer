# 1. Fake the specific conflicting migration (safe approach)
python manage.py migrate staff 0002_attendancerecord_remove_paymentrecord_paid_by_and_more --fake

# 2. Check migration status
python manage.py showmigrations staff

# 3. Continue with remaining migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 4. Verify everything works
python manage.py check
